# Class 1

## Installing Our Tools
### Text Editor
First, go download [Atom](https://atom.io/). Atom is a text editor specifically made for writing code. It writes in "plain text". This is different from "rich text" editors like Microsoft Word or Mac TextEdit. Plain text has no formatting - no fonts, tables, font size, etc. It is purely text. Rich text editors include a bunch of extra information to make text look a certain way. This isn't good for programming because it confuses the computer. We want to use plain text.

### Python Interpreter
Now we need to download Python.
There is a [Windows installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4-amd64.exe) and a [Mac installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0a4-macosx10.6.pkg).

**In the Windows installer, make sure to click the button that says add Python to PATH. This is very important!**

## Using Command Line
Command line is another way of looking at files. Using Windows Explorer or Mac Finder are how we normally look at files on the computer. There's a window, and it has folder icons with names and other information. Many people are comfortable with this way of interacting with a computer.

Before Explorer and Finder, there was Command Line. Instead of clicking folder icons and file names, people would type commands. These commands would open folders, run programs, edit text, and more. We're going to learn some of these commands now.

## Writing our First Program

In programming tradition, it's best to write a simple program that prints "hello world" to the screen. This is to prove that our system is setup correctly and that we can safely run programs.

```
print('hello world')
```
This is called the print function. It prints text to the console. Note that I say it says "prints" text to the console. This is not "output". "output" means something very different that we'll cover later.

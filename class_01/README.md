## Installing our tools
### Text Editor
First, go download [Atom](https://atom.io/). Atom is a text editor specifically made for writing code. It writes in "plain text". This is different from "rich text" editors like Microsoft Word or Mac TextEdit. Plain text has no formatting - no fonts, tables, font size, etc. It is purely text. Rich text editors include a bunch of extra information to make text look a certain way. This isn't good for programming because it confuses the computer. We want to use plain text.

### Python Interpreter
Now we need to download Python.
There is a [Windows installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4-amd64.exe) and a [Mac installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0a4-macosx10.6.pkg).

**In the Windows installer, make sure to click the button that says add Python to PATH. This is very important!**

## 

In programming tradition, it's best to write a simple program that prints "hello world" to the screen. This is to prove that our system is setup correctly and that we can safely run programs.

```
print('hello world')
```
This is called the print function. It prints text to the console. Note that I say it says "prints" text to the console. This is not "output". "output" means something very different that we'll cover later.
